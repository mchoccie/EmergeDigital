# EmergeDigital
Emerge Digital was a capstone project I worked on with 6 others during my third year of university. The web application is meant to be a coaching website where users can sign up and receive some coaching advice based on their area of expertise. This could be work related or even tips for mental health advice.
# Tech Stack
In order to build the application we used a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, ReactJS, Node). This was a fun project for me despite the challenge of learning how to use ReactJS in a few months. I'm definitely no expert, however I have some familiarity and understanding of how React works. 

**Current repository structure**:  

- client: directory for all front-end files & interactions (React, CSS, HTML)  
- server: directory for all back-end files & interactions (Express, Mongoose,
  Node.js)
